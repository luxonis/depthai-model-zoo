# DepthAI - Model ZOO
DepthAI Model Zoo is a collection of open-source neural network models and datasets created and maintained by DepthAI developers and community. Web interface for easier navigation is available at [zoo.luxonis.com](zoo.luxonis.com).

We try to provide already converted latest state-of-the-art models ready for use with DepthAI and our OAK cameras. Most models are accompanied by additional meta data (FPS, accuracy, number of parameters and FLOPs) and links to the experiments that show the example usage of each model.

We invite the community to help out by uploading their models via Pull Requests!
