## mobilenetv2_imagenet_embedder_224x224

This model will output embeddings of the input image, which can be used for tracking purposes.

### Demo

This model is used in [DeepSort Tracking demo](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments/tree/master/gen2-deepsort-tracking). Embeddings are fed into the deepsort algorithm (on the host) which provides accurate tracking.
